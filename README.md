# AssemblyProject
Assembly project to implement a simple traffic lights crossing 

This project was an exercise at the class of Microprocessors in which we learned the basics of Assembly and practised it at 
emu8086 emulator.

The project description was to create a road where cars would be generated after a random amount of time and there would be 
a traffic light in the middle of it. If a car reached it and it was red the car should wait and move after it turns green 
again. Also the color of the light appears at the top right of the screen.
There is a photo of the program running in the repository.
